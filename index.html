        git commit --amend -m "can update the previous commit message and files."
      </p>
      <p>
        git commit --amend --no-edit will just add staged files to the previous commit.
      </p>

        git commit --amend --force-with-lease will not overwrite commits on a remote.
        others have made commits to the remote and pushing an amended commit could
        cause major issues.
